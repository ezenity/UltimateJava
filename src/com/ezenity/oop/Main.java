         * Programming Paradigms
         *  In computer Science you have varies programming paradigms(styles of programming), like:
         *      Procedural
         *      Functional (Most Popular)
         *      Object-oriented (Most Popular)
         *          Everything is based on the concept of objects. these objects contain some data (also called state)
         *          and operations on the data (Also called behaviour). These are the methods or functions that
         *          modify the data.
         *      Event-driven
         *      Logic
         *      Aspect-oriented
         *
         * Not all programmable languages support multiple paradigms. A program language called "SmallTalk (OOP)" only
         * supports a single paradigm. While other languages support multiple paradigms, such as:
         *      Python
         *      Ruby
         *      Java
         *      JavaScript
         *
         * In object-oriented programming, you bring together the data and methods that operate on a single object. Check
         * out the diagram example below
         *       =] Object-oriented [=
         *              Object
         *               Data
         *             Behaviour
         *
         * In functional programming you take the opposite approach. We assume that the data and behavior are fundamentally
         * different, so we keep them separated. See the example below:
         *       =] Functional [=
         *        Data    Behaviour

         * Inheritance & Polymorphism
         * Interfaces
