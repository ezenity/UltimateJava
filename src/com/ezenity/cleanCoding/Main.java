         * Clean Coding
         *
         * As you write code, it is important to keep it clean and organized. For example your house, if it is messy and
         * full of stuff all over the place you're going to have a difficult time looking for something you're looking for.
         * However, if your house is clean and neat you will be able to find stuff easily and fast. We use this same concept
         * in coding as your program grows larger. By breaking down your code into smaller chunks it makes the program
         * easier to read and understand. Another great use for this is that it can be utilized potentially in other programs.
         * This also makes your program more maintainable and easier to extend. In the section you will learn some basics
         * on clean coding and if you would like and in depth course you make check out Mosh's other choruses he has avaialbe
         * for clean coding.
         *
         * In this section we will modify the Mortgage Calculator Project since it is messy and smelly.
